## üîç Project Overview

This repository contains all the code developed to address the Undergraduate Operational Research Challenge for Public Health Scotland. The project aims to develop a detailed model for the Accident & Emergency (A&E) system in Scotland, with the goal of understanding and optimizing patient flow in the hospital system.

Public Health Scotland is Scotland's national agency responsible for improving and protecting the health and well-being of its citizens. The goal is to leverage data and analytics to improve the effectiveness and user experience of the healthcare system.

Complete documentation is available in the `docs` folder:
- `problem_description.pdf`: Detailed description of the challenge
- `Business Report.pdf`: Business report with analysis and recommendations
- `Optimizing Healthcare.pdf`: Complete paper with methodology and results

## üìä Data Management

**Important**: The `/data` directory is excluded from this Git repository for the following reasons:
- **File size**: Large CSV and Excel datasets exceed GitHub's recommended limits
- **Privacy**: Some datasets may contain sensitive healthcare information
- **Local processing**: Data files are processed locally and results are saved in `/results`

To use this repository:
1. Ensure you have the required datasets in the `/data` directory locally
2. Run the analysis scripts which will generate outputs in `/results`
3. The code is designed to work with the expected data structure

### `/docs`: Documentation
- `problem_description.pdf`: Challenge description
- `Business Report.pdf`: Business report
- `Optimizing Healthcare.pdf`: Complete paper

### `/results`: Analysis Results
- **`/images_dir`**: Visualizations and graphs generated from analyses
  - Distribution maps
  - Performance graphs
  - Voronoi visualizations for service areas
- **`/ED`**: Results specific to Emergency Departments
- **`/MIU`**: Results specific to Minor Injury Units
- Model output files (`.Rdata`, `.npz`, `.pkl`)

## üìä Data

The project uses various datasets provided by Public Health Scotland:
- Monthly A&E activity data
- Patient demographic data
- Geographic data of existing healthcare facilities
- Population data by geographic area

**Note**: Datasets are not included in the GitHub repository due to size and sharing policies. Contact the authors for access to the necessary data.

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- R 4.0+
