# A&E Model Development for Public Health Scotland

This repository contains all the code used to address the Undergraduate Operational Research Challenge for Public Health Scotland. The project aims to develop a more detailed Accident & Emergency (A&E) model to understand the flow of patients being admitted to the hospital system. 

A full description of the challenge can be found in the `problem_description.pdf` file in this repository. For more information about the challenge, please visit the [Undergraduate Operational Research Challenge](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/events/operational-research-challenge).

Public Health Scotland is Scotlandâ€™s national agency responsible for improving and protecting the health and well-being of its citizens. Their goal is to leverage intelligence and data to enhance the healthcare system's effectiveness and user experience.
