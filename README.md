# A&E Model Development for Public Health Scotland

This repository contains all the code used to address the challenge titled **"Supporting our development of an A&E model/s"** for Public Health Scotland. The project aims to develop a more detailed Accident & Emergency (A&E) model to understand the flow of patients being admitted to the hospital system. The model will contribute to predicting the demand for A&E services, building on an existing acute hospital model.

Public Health Scotland is Scotlandâ€™s national agency responsible for improving and protecting the health and well-being of its citizens. Their goal is to leverage intelligence and data to enhance the healthcare system's effectiveness and user experience.

### Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide code and methods to support the development of an A&E model that will:
- Predict demand for A&E services
- Model the flow of patients being admitted to the hospital system
- Contribute to ongoing improvements in healthcare planning and management

### Repository Structure
This repository contains two main components:
1. **R Code** (Managed by Camilla Andreozzi):  
   R scripts for data processing, modeling, and analysis related to A&E demand prediction.
   
2. **Python Notebooks** (Managed by Glauco Rampone):  
   Jupyter notebooks containing Python code used for the development and testing of the A&E model, including data analysis and predictive modeling.

### Project Components
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Modeling**: Developing the A&E model using both statistical and machine learning techniques.
- **Analysis**: Evaluating the model's performance and its ability to predict demand and patient flow.
- **Visualization**: Visual tools for understanding model outcomes and insights.

### Usage
To run the code:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ae-model-development.git
   ```

2. Install required libraries in **R**:
    ```R
    install.packages("...")
    install.packages("...")
    ```

3. Install required libraries in **Python**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the R scripts and Python notebooks to replicate the model development and analysis.
